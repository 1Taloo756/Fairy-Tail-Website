                <div class="flex fight-part">
                    <p class="text-center">The fights in Fairy Tail are more than just magical showdowns—they are filled with emotion, character growth, and deep personal meaning. Each battle reflects the inner struggles of the characters, often turning into moments of transformation or revelation. The magic system allows for diverse combat styles—from Natsu’s fiery close-range attacks to Erza’s armored swordplay and Gray’s creative ice techniques. Fights usually occur during major arcs such as guild wars, tournaments, or when dark guilds threaten the peace. Notable battles include Natsu vs. Gajeel, Erza vs. Azuma, Gray vs. Silver, and the final epic war against Zeref and Acnologia. What makes these fights stand out is the way characters draw strength from their friends, memories, and determination to protect what they love. Victory often comes not from being stronger, but from having the will to never give up.</p>

Yajeel is a minor character but mentioned as one of the mages considered by the Magic Council to potentially replace fallen or retired Wizard Saints. While not officially confirmed as a full member in the story, characters like him represent how the council sometimes appoints saints based on influence or political stability rather than pure strength. Yajeel and others like him serve to highlight that the title of Wizard Saint can sometimes be symbolic, especially for those outside the "Four Gods of Ishgar."

Org was one of the older members of the Magic Council and held a Wizard Saint title in previous generations. While his magic and backstory are not deeply shown, he was respected for his magical knowledge and leadership. Org was a traditionalist who often clashed with Makarov’s ideology, especially when Fairy Tail’s destructive methods came under question. He later died when the Tower of Heaven exploded. His presence reminds us that Wizard Saints can also serve within magical politics — not just the battlefield.
